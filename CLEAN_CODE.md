# Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship
By Robert C Martin

## Chapter 1: Clean Code
This chapter introduces the concept of clean code and emphasizes its importance. It discusses the characteristics of clean code and provides insights from various well-known programmers on what clean code means to them.

## Chapter 2: Meaningful Names
This chapter focuses on the importance of using meaningful names for variables, functions, classes, and other entities in code. It provides guidelines on how to choose names that clearly convey the purpose and usage of the code elements.

## Chapter 3: Functions
The chapter delves into best practices for writing functions. It emphasizes that functions should be small, do one thing, have descriptive names, and have minimal side effects. It also discusses the importance of proper function argument usage.

## Chapter 4: Comments
This chapter discusses the role of comments in code. While comments can be helpful, the emphasis is on writing self-explanatory code that minimizes the need for comments. When comments are necessary, they should be clear, concise, and relevant.

## Chapter 5: Formatting
The chapter covers the importance of code formatting for readability and maintainability. It provides guidelines on indentation, spacing, and other formatting conventions to make the code easier to read and understand.

## Chapter 6: Objects and Data Structures
This chapter explains the differences between objects and data structures and how to use them appropriately. It discusses encapsulation, data abstraction, and the Law of Demeter.

#### **Data Abstraction**
- **Abstract Representation**: The importance of representing data in abstract terms rather than concrete details.
  - **Example**: Instead of exposing internal fields directly, provide methods that abstract away the details.
  - **Bad Example**: 
    ```java
    class Point {
        public double x;
        public double y;
    }
    ```
  - **Good Example**:
    ```java
    class Point {
        private double x;
        private double y;
        
        public double getX() { return x; }
        public double getY() { return y; }
    }
    ```

#### **Data/Object Anti-Symmetry**
- **Definition**: Objects hide their data behind abstractions and expose functions that operate on that data, while data structures expose their data and have no meaningful functions.
  - **Objects**: Encapsulate behavior and hide internal state.
  - **Data Structures**: Expose data and lack behavior.

- **Example of Object-Oriented Approach**:
  ```java
  class Circle {
      private double radius;
      
      public double getArea() {
          return Math.PI * radius * radius;
      }
  }
  ```
- **Example of Procedural Approach**:
  ```java
  class Circle {
      public double radius;
  }
  
  class Geometry {
      public static double getArea(Circle c) {
          return Math.PI * c.radius * c.radius;
      }
  }
  ```

#### **The Law of Demeter**
- **Definition**: A method should only call methods on objects that are:
  1. Itself.
  2. Its parameters.
  3. Any objects it creates/instantiates.
  4. Its direct component objects.

- **Purpose**: Reduce coupling between classes and increase maintainability.

- **Bad Example (Violating Law of Demeter)**:
  ```java
  final String outputDir = ctxt.getOptions().getScratchDir().getAbsolutePath();
  ```

- **Good Example**:
  ```java
  final String outputDir = ctxt.getScratchDirAbsolutePath();
  ```

#### **Train Wrecks**
- **Definition**: A long chain of method calls that exposes the internal structure of an object.
- **Example of Train Wreck**:
  ```java
  final String outputDir = ctxt.getOptions().getScratchDir().getAbsolutePath();
  ```
- **Solution**: Encapsulate the chain within a method.
  ```java
  final String outputDir = ctxt.getScratchDirAbsolutePath();
  ```

#### **Hybrids**
- **Definition**: Classes that are neither good objects nor good data structures. They have both exposed data and behavior.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  class Hybrid {
      public int x;
      public int y;
      public void move(int deltaX, int deltaY) {
          this.x += deltaX;
          this.y += deltaY;
      }
  }
  ```
- **Solution**: Decide whether the class should be an object or a data structure and refactor accordingly.

#### **Hiding Structure**
- **Definition**: Objects should hide their internal structure and expose a simple interface.
- **Example of Hiding Structure**:
  ```java
  class Vehicle {
      private Engine engine;
      
      public void start() {
          engine.start();
      }
  }
  ```

#### **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)**
- **Definition**: Simple data structures used for transferring data without behavior.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  class AddressDTO {
      public String street;
      public String city;
      public String state;
      public String zipCode;
  }
  ```

#### **Comparison: Objects vs. Data Structures**
- **Objects**: Encapsulate data and provide behaviors. They are more complex but offer better encapsulation and abstraction.
- **Data Structures**: Simple and straightforward, but don't hide their internal data. They are easier to manipulate but can lead to more coupling.

## Chapter 7: Error Handling
The focus here is on handling errors gracefully and effectively. The chapter advocates for using exceptions rather than error codes, writing clean try-catch-finally blocks, and avoiding returning null or passing null as an argument.

#### **Use Exceptions Rather Than Return Codes**
- **Problem with Return Codes**: They clutter the caller with error-checking logic and obscure the main logic of the code.
- **Example of Return Codes**:
  ```java
  if (deletePage(page) == E_OK) {
      if (registry.deleteReference(page.name) == E_OK) {
          if (configKeys.deleteKey(page.name.makeKey()) != E_OK) {
              logger.log("Error deleting key.");
          }
      } else {
          logger.log("Error deleting reference.");
      }
  } else {
      logger.log("Error deleting page.");
  }
  ```
- **Using Exceptions**: Simplifies the error handling by separating error processing from the main logic.
  ```java
  try {
      deletePage(page);
      registry.deleteReference(page.name);
      configKeys.deleteKey(page.name.makeKey());
  } catch (Exception e) {
      logger.log(e.getMessage());
  }
  ```

#### **Extract Try/Catch Blocks**
- **Problem**: Try/catch blocks can confuse the structure of the code and mix error processing with normal processing.
- **Solution**: Extract the bodies of the try and catch blocks into separate methods.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  public void delete(Page page) {
      try {
          deletePageAndAllReferences(page);
      } catch (Exception e) {
          logError(e);
      }
  }

  private void deletePageAndAllReferences(Page page) throws Exception {
      deletePage(page);
      registry.deleteReference(page.name);
      configKeys.deleteKey(page.name.makeKey());
  }

  private void logError(Exception e) {
      logger.log(e.getMessage());
  }
  ```

#### **Write Your Try-Catch-Finally Statement First**
- **Guideline**: Write the try-catch-finally statement before writing the code that goes inside it. This ensures that you handle errors from the beginning.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  try {
      // Code that might throw an exception
  } catch (Exception e) {
      // Error handling code
  } finally {
      // Cleanup code, if necessary
  }
  ```

#### **Use Unchecked Exceptions**
- **Checked vs. Unchecked Exceptions**: Favor unchecked exceptions because they reduce the amount of boilerplate code and make your API easier to use.
- **Example**: Instead of forcing the caller to handle a checked exception, you can throw an unchecked exception.
  ```java
  public void method() {
      if (someConditionFails) {
          throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid argument");
      }
  }
  ```

#### **Provide Context with Exceptions**
- **Contextual Information**: Include as much context as possible in your exceptions to make debugging easier.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  public void withdraw(double amount) {
      if (amount > balance) {
          throw new InsufficientFundsException("Attempt to withdraw " + amount + " with balance of " + balance);
      }
      balance -= amount;
  }
  ```

#### **Define Exception Classes in Terms of a Caller’s Needs**
- **Custom Exceptions**: Create custom exceptions that make sense in the context of the caller’s needs.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  public class InsufficientFundsException extends RuntimeException {
      public InsufficientFundsException(String message) {
          super(message);
      }
  }
  ```

#### **Define the Normal Flow**
- **Normal vs. Error Flow**: Ensure that the normal flow of your code is not interrupted by error handling logic.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  public void processOrder(Order order) {
      try {
          validateOrder(order);
          chargeCustomer(order);
          shipOrder(order);
      } catch (ValidationException e) {
          handleError(e);
      } catch (PaymentException e) {
          handleError(e);
      } catch (ShippingException e) {
          handleError(e);
      }
  }
  ```

#### **Don’t Return Null**
- **Avoid Null**: Returning null can lead to null pointer exceptions and makes the caller responsible for handling null checks.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  // Instead of this:
  public Customer findCustomer(String id) {
      // return null if customer not found
  }

  // Do this:
  public Optional<Customer> findCustomer(String id) {
      // return Optional.empty() if customer not found
  }
  ```

#### **Don’t Pass Null**
- **Avoid Passing Null**: Passing null as an argument can lead to unexpected null pointer exceptions.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  // Instead of this:
  public void process(Customer customer) {
      if (customer == null) {
          throw new IllegalArgumentException("Customer cannot be null");
      }
      // process customer
  }

  // Ensure non-null arguments:
  public void process(Customer customer) {
      Objects.requireNonNull(customer, "Customer cannot be null");
      // process customer
  }
  ```

## Chapter 8: Boundaries
This chapter discusses managing boundaries within a codebase, such as external libraries and APIs. It emphasizes the importance of keeping these boundaries clean and using appropriate patterns to minimize their impact on the rest of the code.

## Chapter 9: Unit Tests
This chapter covers the principles of writing good unit tests. It stresses the importance of having automated tests, writing clean tests, and following the FIRST principles (Fast, Independent, Repeatable, Self-Validating, and Timely).

## Chapter 10: Classes
The chapter provides guidelines for designing and organizing classes. It discusses the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), the Open/Closed Principle (OCP), and other object-oriented design principles to create cohesive and maintainable classes.

## Chapter 11: Systems
This chapter looks at the broader picture of software systems, including architecture and design. It discusses the importance of keeping the system clean, managing dependencies, and using design patterns effectively.

## Chapter 12: Emergence
The chapter introduces the concept of emergent design, which is the idea that a clean and robust design can emerge from following simple rules and principles. It discusses the four rules of simple design: runs all tests, contains no duplication, expresses the intent of the programmer, and minimizes the number of classes and methods.

## Chapter 13: Concurrency
This chapter addresses the challenges of writing concurrent code. It provides guidelines for managing concurrency, avoiding common pitfalls, and ensuring that concurrent code is clean and maintainable.

## Chapter 14: Successive Refinement

This chapter provides a case study on the internals of the JUnit framework, demonstrating the application of clean code principles in a real-world context.

## Chapter 16: Refactoring SerialDate
This chapter is a detailed case study of refactoring the SerialDate class. It illustrates the process of transforming messy code into clean code through a series of small, incremental changes.

## Chapter 17: Smells and Heuristics
The final chapter provides a comprehensive list of "code smells" (indications of potential problems in the code) and heuristics (rules of thumb) for identifying and addressing these issues to maintain clean code.

### **Smells and Heuristics Overview**
- **Code Smells**: Indicators of potential problems in the code that may require refactoring.
- **Heuristics**: Rules of thumb or guidelines to help maintain clean code.

### **Key Smells and Heuristics**

#### **Bloaters**
- **Long Method**: Methods that are too long and do too much.
  - **Example**: A method with multiple levels of abstraction handling different responsibilities.
- **Large Class**: Classes that have grown too large and handle too many responsibilities.
  - **Example**: A single class managing user input, data processing, and output display.
- **Primitive Obsession**: Overuse of primitive data types instead of small objects for simple tasks.
  - **Example**: Using multiple `int` or `String` fields for related data instead of a single class encapsulating that data.
- **Long Parameter List**: Methods that take too many parameters.
  - **Example**: A method with more than three or four parameters, which can often be replaced by a single parameter object.

#### **Object-Orientation Abusers**
- **Switch Statements**: Overuse of switch statements instead of polymorphism.
  - **Example**: A switch statement determining behavior based on type instead of using a method in a subclass.
- **Temporary Field**: Fields that are only set or used in specific situations.
  - **Example**: A field that's only relevant for one method and not the rest of the class.
- **Refused Bequest**: Subclasses that don't use the inherited methods or data.
  - **Example**: A subclass that overrides most of the parent class methods with its own implementations.

#### **Change Preventers**
- **Divergent Change**: A class that suffers many changes for different reasons.
  - **Example**: A class that changes frequently for reasons related to different functionalities.
- **Shotgun Surgery**: A single change that requires altering many different classes.
  - **Example**: Changing a feature that requires updates across multiple unrelated classes.

#### **Dispensables**
- **Duplicate Code**: Code that appears multiple times in the codebase.
  - **Example**: Identical code blocks in different methods that can be refactored into a single method.
- **Lazy Class**: Classes that have too little functionality and don't justify their existence.
  - **Example**: A class that only holds a couple of methods or fields.
- **Data Class**: Classes that only contain fields and accessors without behavior.
  - **Example**: A class with only getters and setters.

#### **Couplers**
- **Feature Envy**: A method that seems more interested in another class than the one it is in.
  - **Example**: A method that uses more methods from another class than its own.
- **Inappropriate Intimacy**: Classes that are too familiar with each other's internals.
  - **Example**: Two classes that access each other's private fields directly.
- **Message Chains**: A sequence of calls to different methods.
  - **Example**: `a.getB().getC().doSomething()`.

#### **Others**
- **Comments**: Over-reliance on comments to explain code instead of writing self-explanatory code.
  - **Example**: A method with complex logic explained through comments rather than clear, descriptive code.
- **Incomplete Library Class**: Using a library class that requires extensions or modifications.
  - **Example**: Extending a third-party library class to add missing functionality.
- **Data Clumps**: Groups of data that are often passed together.
  - **Example**: Multiple method parameters that are always passed together and could be encapsulated in a single class.

### **Examples from the Book**
- **Long Method Example**: Refactoring a long method into smaller methods each handling a single responsibility.
- **Duplicate Code Example**: Identifying similar code blocks in different classes and refactoring them into a shared utility method.
- **Feature Envy Example**: Moving a method to the class where most of the data it manipulates is located.

### **Heuristic Rules**
- **SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)**: A class should have only one reason to change.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid code duplication.
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Simplicity should be a key goal in design.
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Don't add functionality until it's necessary.
- **Law of Demeter**: A method should only talk to its immediate friends, not the friends of its friends.
