# Designing Distributed Systems
By Brendan Burns

## Chapter 1: Introduction
- Overview of distributed systems and their importance in modern computing.
- Emphasis on the need for reliability, agility, and scalability.
- Introduction to design patterns as a way to regularize and improve the practice of distributed system development.
- Goal of the book: to provide reusable design patterns for distributed systems.

## Chapter 2: Single-Node Patterns
- Discussion about single-node patterns that form the building blocks of distributed systems.
- Examples include:
  - Singleton pattern for ensuring a class has only one instance.
  - Factory pattern for creating objects without specifying the exact class.
  - Proxy pattern for controlling access to objects.

## Chapter 3: Multi-Node Patterns
- Introduction to multi-node patterns for building distributed systems.
- Patterns are not mutually exclusive and can be combined.
- Examples include:
  - Replicated load-balanced services, where identical servers support traffic.
  - Sharding pattern, where data is partitioned across multiple nodes.

## Chapter 4: Data Management Patterns
- Patterns for managing data in distributed systems.
- Examples include:
  - Event Sourcing, where state changes are stored as a sequence of events.
  - CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation), separating read and write operations.

## Chapter 5: Replicated Load-Balanced Services
- Detailed discussion of replicated load-balanced services as a fundamental pattern.
- Benefits include fault tolerance and improved performance.
- Code Example:
  ```python
  # Pseudocode for a load balancer
  class LoadBalancer:
      def __init__(self):
          self.servers = []

      def add_server(self, server):
          self.servers.append(server)

      def get_server(self, request):
          # Simple round-robin load balancing
          return self.servers[request.id % len(self.servers)]
  ```

## Chapter 6: Service Discovery Patterns
- Patterns for enabling services to find each other in a distributed system.
- Examples include:
  - DNS-based discovery, where services are registered with DNS.
  - Client-side discovery, where clients are responsible for discovering service instances.

## Chapter 7: Messaging Patterns
- Patterns for communication between distributed components.
- Examples include:
  - Publish-subscribe pattern, where messages are broadcasted to multiple subscribers.
  - Message queues, where messages are stored and processed asynchronously.

#### 1. **Publish-Subscribe Pattern**
- **Concept**: The publish-subscribe pattern (pub-sub) is a messaging pattern where messages are sent by publishers and received by multiple subscribers. The publisher does not need to know the identity of the subscribers.
- **Use Cases**: Real-time notifications, event broadcasting, logging systems.
- **Components**:
  - **Publisher**: Sends messages to a topic.
  - **Subscriber**: Listens for messages from a topic.
  - **Broker**: Manages topics and distributes messages to subscribers.
- **Benefits**:
  - Decoupling of publishers and subscribers.
  - Scalability, as new subscribers can be added without changing the publisher.
- **Challenges**:
  - Ensuring message delivery to all subscribers.
  - Handling large volumes of messages efficiently.

- **Code Example** (Python with a hypothetical pub-sub library):
  ```python
  from pubsub import Publisher, Subscriber, Broker

  # Create a broker
  broker = Broker()

  # Define a publisher
  class NewsPublisher(Publisher):
      def publish_news(self, news):
          self.publish('news', news)

  # Define a subscriber
  class NewsSubscriber(Subscriber):
      def __init__(self, name):
          super().__init__(name)
          self.subscribe('news')

      def on_message(self, topic, message):
          print(f"{self.name} received news: {message}")

  # Create publisher and subscribers
  publisher = NewsPublisher(broker)
  subscriber1 = NewsSubscriber('Subscriber 1')
  subscriber2 = NewsSubscriber('Subscriber 2')

  # Publish a message
  publisher.publish_news("Breaking news: New messaging pattern discovered!")
  ```

#### 2. **Message Queues**
- **Concept**: Message queues allow messages to be stored and processed asynchronously. Producers send messages to the queue, and consumers retrieve and process them.
- **Use Cases**: Task scheduling, load leveling, background processing.
- **Components**:
  - **Producer**: Sends messages to the queue.
  - **Queue**: Stores messages until they are processed.
  - **Consumer**: Retrieves and processes messages from the queue.
- **Benefits**:
  - Decoupling of message production and consumption.
  - Improved system resilience and fault tolerance.
- **Challenges**:
  - Ensuring message delivery and handling duplicates.
  - Managing queue length and preventing bottlenecks.

- **Code Example** (Python with a hypothetical message queue library):
  ```python
  from message_queue import MessageQueue, Producer, Consumer

  # Create a message queue
  queue = MessageQueue()

  # Define a producer
  class TaskProducer(Producer):
      def produce_task(self, task):
          self.send(queue, task)

  # Define a consumer
  class TaskConsumer(Consumer):
      def consume_tasks(self):
          while True:
              task = self.receive(queue)
              if task:
                  print(f"Processing task: {task}")

  # Create producer and consumer
  producer = TaskProducer()
  consumer = TaskConsumer()

  # Produce and consume tasks
  producer.produce_task("Task 1")
  producer.produce_task("Task 2")
  consumer.consume_tasks()
  ```

#### 3. **Request-Reply Pattern**
- **Concept**: The request-reply pattern involves a client sending a request message to a server and waiting for a reply message. This is a synchronous communication pattern.
- **Use Cases**: Remote procedure calls (RPC), synchronous API calls.
- **Components**:
  - **Client**: Sends a request and waits for a reply.
  - **Server**: Receives the request, processes it, and sends a reply.
- **Benefits**:
  - Simplifies client-server interactions.
  - Suitable for scenarios requiring immediate feedback.
- **Challenges**:
  - Increased latency due to synchronous communication.
  - Handling server failures and ensuring reliability.

- **Code Example** (Python with a hypothetical request-reply library):
  ```python
  from request_reply import Client, Server

  # Define a server
  class EchoServer(Server):
      def on_request(self, request):
          return f"Echo: {request}"

  # Define a client
  class EchoClient(Client):
      def send_request(self, message):
          response = self.request('echo', message)
          print(f"Received reply: {response}")

  # Create server and client
  server = EchoServer()
  client = EchoClient()

  # Send a request and receive a reply
  client.send_request("Hello, server!")
  ```

#### 4. **Event-Driven Pattern**
- **Concept**: In the event-driven pattern, components communicate by producing and consuming events. An event is a significant change in state or occurrence.
- **Use Cases**: Real-time analytics, monitoring systems, responsive UIs.
- **Components**:
  - **Event Producer**: Generates events.
  - **Event Consumer**: Listens for and processes events.
  - **Event Broker**: Manages event distribution.
- **Benefits**:
  - High decoupling and flexibility.
  - Scalability and responsiveness.
- **Challenges**:
  - Ensuring event order and consistency.
  - Handling event storms and ensuring timely processing.

- **Code Example** (Python with a hypothetical event-driven library):
  ```python
  from event_driven import EventProducer, EventConsumer, EventBroker

  # Create an event broker
  broker = EventBroker()

  # Define an event producer
  class Sensor(EventProducer):
      def generate_event(self, data):
          self.emit('sensor_data', data)

  # Define an event consumer
  class DataProcessor(EventConsumer):
      def __init__(self):
          super().__init__()
          self.subscribe('sensor_data')

      def on_event(self, event, data):
          print(f"Processing event: {event} with data: {data}")

  # Create producer and consumer
  sensor = Sensor(broker)
  processor = DataProcessor()

  # Generate and process events
  sensor.generate_event({"temperature": 22.5})
  sensor.generate_event({"temperature": 23.0})
  ```
