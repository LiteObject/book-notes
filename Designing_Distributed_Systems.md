# Designing Distributed Systems
By Brendan Burns

## Chapter 1: Introduction
- Overview of distributed systems and their importance in modern computing.
- Emphasis on the need for reliability, agility, and scalability.
- Introduction to design patterns as a way to regularize and improve the practice of distributed system development.
- Goal of the book: to provide reusable design patterns for distributed systems.

## Chapter 2: Single-Node Patterns
- Discussion about single-node patterns that form the building blocks of distributed systems.
- Examples include:
  - Singleton pattern for ensuring a class has only one instance.
  - Factory pattern for creating objects without specifying the exact class.
  - Proxy pattern for controlling access to objects.

## Chapter 3: Multi-Node Patterns
- Introduction to multi-node patterns for building distributed systems.
- Patterns are not mutually exclusive and can be combined.
- Examples include:
  - Replicated load-balanced services, where identical servers support traffic.
  - Sharding pattern, where data is partitioned across multiple nodes.

## Chapter 4: Data Management Patterns
- Patterns for managing data in distributed systems.
- Examples include:
  - Event Sourcing, where state changes are stored as a sequence of events.
  - CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation), separating read and write operations.

## Chapter 5: Replicated Load-Balanced Services
- Detailed discussion of replicated load-balanced services as a fundamental pattern.
- Benefits include fault tolerance and improved performance.
- Code Example:
  ```python
  # Pseudocode for a load balancer
  class LoadBalancer:
      def __init__(self):
          self.servers = []

      def add_server(self, server):
          self.servers.append(server)

      def get_server(self, request):
          # Simple round-robin load balancing
          return self.servers[request.id % len(self.servers)]
  ```

## Chapter 6: Service Discovery Patterns
- Patterns for enabling services to find each other in a distributed system.
- Examples include:
  - DNS-based discovery, where services are registered with DNS.
  - Client-side discovery, where clients are responsible for discovering service instances.

## Chapter 7: Messaging Patterns
- Patterns for communication between distributed components.
- Examples include:
  - Publish-subscribe pattern, where messages are broadcasted to multiple subscribers.
  - Message queues, where messages are stored and processed asynchronously.

## Chapter 8: Resiliency Patterns
- Patterns to ensure system reliability and fault tolerance.
- Examples include:
  - Circuit Breaker, to prevent cascading failures.
  - Bulkhead, to isolate different parts of the system to prevent failure spread.

## Chapter 9: Monitoring and Logging Patterns
- Patterns for observing and logging system behavior.
- Examples include:
  - Centralized logging, where logs from different services are aggregated.
  - Distributed tracing, to track requests across service boundaries.

## Chapter 10: Security Patterns
- Patterns to secure distributed systems.
- Examples include:
  - Authentication and Authorization, to control access to services.
  - Encryption, to secure data in transit and at rest.

## Chapter 11: Deployment Patterns
- Patterns for deploying distributed systems.
- Examples include:
  - Blue-Green Deployment, to reduce downtime during deployments.
  - Canary Releases, to gradually roll out changes and monitor their impact.

## Chapter 12: Conclusion
- Recap of the importance of design patterns in distributed systems.
- Encouragement to use the patterns as a guide for building robust, scalable, and maintainable systems.
- Final thoughts on the future of distributed system design.
